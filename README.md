Note: This app is the primitive version of my project "HR Job Application Management System for Internal and External Job Applications" in SOCAR,
and just shows general image and nature of the project due to the confidentiality. By implementing this project as a hobby project, 
the aim is to show some of my Software Engineering skills.

Info: This app was designed to create a database, consisting of resumes of users, and provide web interface for them. 
Furthermore, new resumes can be added to the database, existing resumes can be updated and deleted. 
All necessary sections of CV (general information, contact information, experience, and skills) can easily be modified, added, and deleted. 
Overall project was designed based on OOP standards and SOLID principles.
After database design, ORM (JPA) was used to convert data between the relational database (MySQL) and the heap of the OOP language (Java).
After web application was created by using JavaEE, the overall project was written by using Spring Framework.
